## INTRODUCTION
 In the wake of pandemic  a sense of euphoria about online voting could be felt in many countries and election expert communities alike. After all, this seemed the logical next frontier of the internet: making elections more convenient, accessible and cheaper.This project aims to solve a few problems associated with the  traditional in-person voting system by devising an online based voting system where the user does not have to go to the polling booth to cast their votes ,instead do it from any desktop/laptop that has internet accessibility.
